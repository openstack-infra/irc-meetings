agenda:  |
  * Greetings, Announcements, etc
  * Sub-team status reports
  ** Integration Testing
  *** Tempest CI status
  *** TripleO CI status
  ** Status of Fedora on devstack with Ironic
  *** IPv6 enabled boxes vs TFTP (xinet.d defaults to listening on IPv6 endpoint
      only, at least on Fedora)
  **** https://review.openstack.org/#/c/87594/ - DevStack patch
  **** https://review.openstack.org/#/c/87208/ - TripleO patch
  *** Ironic Python Agent
  * Discussion Topics
  ** Do we really need the Chassis object? Should we replace it with tag groups?
  * Open Discussion:
  ** How to merge large amount of tests refactoring review requests? These
     include at least: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. Nearly any change to tests break some
     or all of these review requests, so it seems hard to finish and merge them
     without stopping approving other changes for a while.
  ** Hardware discovery extension for agent. blueprint
