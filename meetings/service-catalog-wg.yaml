description:  >
  This is a weekly 30 minute virtual standup to see where our progress
  is for the overall effort. It is assumed most folks won't attend the
  meeting but will instead update our virtual standup etherpad before
  the meeting. This will just be a checkpoint and point at the top
  issue that needs to be focussed on for the next week.
