description:  >
  After hearing the recaps from the summit, it sounds like policy was a hot
  topic (per usual). This is also reinforced by the fact every release we have
  specifications proposed to re-do policy in some way. It's no doubt policy in
  OpenStack needs work. Let's dedicate an hour a week to policy, analyze what
  we have currently, design an ideal solution, and aim for that.
