description:  >
  Policy in OpenStack needs some work. This meeting is dedicated to working
  through the existing implementation and finding ways to improve it. The
  discussions may involve other projects and those developers are encouraged
  to attend. Since oslo is currently the policy-decision-point and
  policy-enforcement-point for deployments, the outcomes of this meeting
  might effect that project.
