  This is a weekly meeting review Nova Bugs. The initial focus will be  on
  triaging bugs in the New state and ensuring that critical bugs are making
  progress. Once the new queue is under control we will switch our focus to
  reviewing incomplete bugs, removing assignees from stale bugs so others
  can pick them up (especially low hanging fruit). In general we will follow
  the policies documented here https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/BugTriage
