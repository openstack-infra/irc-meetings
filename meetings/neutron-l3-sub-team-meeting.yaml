  ** Reviewing HA Router Functionality
  *** There are some relationships between the reviews.
  *** After reading the blueprint, a good starting place for review is the Add
      L3 VRRP HA base classes review. It does not have any dependencies and
      adds the framework. It creates the HA management network and ports, adds
      database support, etc. After that, there are two patches to be reviewed.
      They are mostly independent of each other.
  **** Add a new scheduler for the l3 HA
  **** Introduces a keepalived manager for HA
  *** Finally, the Add HA support to the l3 agent review seems to pull them all
      together.
  *** Introduces a conntrackd manager for HA
  ** Testing HA Router Functionality
  *** How to test L3 HA VRRP
