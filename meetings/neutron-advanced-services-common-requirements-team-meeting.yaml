  It was felt that we should have a separate meeting to discuss the topics
  common to all services. Hence the OpenStack Networking Team (Neutron) holds
  public meetings in ##openstack-meeting-3. Everyone is encouraged to attend.
  This meeting will discuss the common requirements for FWaaS, LBaaS, VPNaaS,
  L3/routers, Group Policy. The meetings are on Wednesdays at 1730 UTC.
