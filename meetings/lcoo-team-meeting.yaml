description:  >
  The LCOO (Large Contributing OpenStack Operators) working group
  is a group of organizations merging our requirements and upstream
  community teams.  Typically we are operating openstack for our own
  internal business needs in a distributed/multi-cloud arrangement.
  Join us to introduce and investigte collaboration.  The LCOO
  holds a bi-weekly team meeting simultaneously in IRC and in Webex.
