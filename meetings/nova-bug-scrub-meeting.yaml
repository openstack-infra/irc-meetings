description:    'This is a weekly meeting review Nova Bugs. The initial focus will be on triaging bugs in the New state and ensuring that critical bugs are making progress. Once the New queue is under control we will switch our focus to reviewing incomplete bugs, removing assignees from stale bugs so others can pick them up (especially low hanging fruit)'

    - triage new
    - review critical
