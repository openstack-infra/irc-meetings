description:  >
  The OpenStack Technical Committee is one of the governing bodies of the
  OpenStack project. It is an elected group that represents the
  contributors to the project, and has oversight on all technical matters.
  The Technical Committee is formally defined in the OpenStack Foundation
  bylaws and further refined in the Technical Committee charter.

  Office hours are an informal time for general discussion without a
  pre-planned agenda. Anyone may raise issues to the TC in
  #openstack-tc or via the mailing list at any point, but office hours
  are times when TC members try to be online and available for
  informal synchronous discussions.
