  Search is a new project being split out of Glance based on the
  Catalog Index Service, which was developed and released in Kilo.
  At the Liberty Summit we decided to broaden the scope and pursue
  making it its own project with a goal to provide advanced and scalable
  search across multi-tenant cloud resources. The final name for the search
  project is still being finalized. Everyone is welcome to attend.
