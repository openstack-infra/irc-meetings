description:  >
    The Stewardship Working Group (SWG) will be responsible for producing actionable
    recommendations and improvements to the processes and procedures of OpenStack as they relate
    to leadership and governance that the TC can then consider for adoption and roll out to the
    OpenStack community. Anyone interested in leadership, stewardship, and OpenStack is welcome
    to join the working group. The group is strictly advisory, and all final decisions about any
    changes proposed by the SWG will be made by the TC.
