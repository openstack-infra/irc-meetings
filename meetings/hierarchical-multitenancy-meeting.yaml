  We have regular meetings on Friday at 1600 UTC in #openstack-meeting.
  OpenStack needs to grow support for hierarchical ownership of objects. This
  enables the management subsets of users and projects in a way that is much
  more comfortable for private clouds. Adding this type of feature will require
  work across all of the projects in OpenStack. Traditionally efforts like this
  have stalled out because of the amount of collaboration required. For this
  reason, the goal is to make a small cross-functional team to design and
  implement this feature by producing real code.
