description:  >
  To provide nova, heat, reddwarf and other openstack projects (in incubation
  or core) a more structured state management library, routines, and code
  patterns to incrementally move toward a programming model which hopefully can
  be easier to ['audit', 'automate', 'extend', 'resume', 'revert', 'review',
  'schedule', 'understand', '...'].
