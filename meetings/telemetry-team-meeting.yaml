description: >
  The telemetry requirements of an OpenStack environment are vast and varied,
  they include use cases such as metering, monitoring, and alarming to name a
  few. The scope of these uses cases is diverse and beyond the scope of a
  single project and team. Currently, the telemetry project provides a set of
  functionality split across multiple projects; each project designed to
  provide a discrete service in the telemetry space.
