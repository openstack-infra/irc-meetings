  * Stephen's API proposal
  ** https://docs.google.com/document/d/129Da7zEk5p437_88_IKiQnNuWXzWaS_CpQVm4JBeQnc/edit#heading=h.hgpfh6kl7j7a
  ** The document proposes the API that covers pretty much of the features that
     we've identified on the requirements page. The use cases are being
     addressed also. We need to converge on general approach proposed there.
  * Summit Agenda
  ** We have two sessions at the neutron track. It makes sense to focus on the
     topics that will benefit most from face-to-face discussion.
