  If you're interested in Congress, join us for public meetings on IRC.
  We use the logs of previous meetings to record action items, and we do a
  quick survey at the start of each meeting to see what is on the agenda.
  If you are interested but the meeting time is bad for you or your time zone, please email Eric Kao <ekcs.openstack@gmail.com>.
