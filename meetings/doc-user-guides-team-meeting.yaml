  The OpenStack User Guides team holds one public meeting per month
  on IRC. The meeting is set at 0630 UTC. We meet on the second
  Thursday of the month.
  Previous meetings were held at an APAC and US meeting time. Until
  further updates, the User Guides team meeting will be held in a
  time that aligns with APAC and European timezones. This best fits
  our current team contributor locations.
