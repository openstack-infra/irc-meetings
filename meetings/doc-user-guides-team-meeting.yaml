  The OpenStack User Guides team holds one public meeting per month
  on IRC. The meeting is set at 0630 UTC. Previous meetings were
  held at an APAC and US meeting time. Until further updates, the
  User Guides team meeting will be held in a time that aligns with
  APAC and European timezones. This best fits our current team
  contributor locations.
