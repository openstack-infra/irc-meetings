  The OpenStack Technical Committee is one of the governing bodies of the
  OpenStack project. It is an elected group that represents the
  contributors to the project, and has oversight on all technical matters.
  The Technical Committee is formally defined in the OpenStack Foundation
  bylaws and further refined in the Technical Committee charter.
