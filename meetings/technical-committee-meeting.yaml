  The OpenStack Technical Committee is one of the governing bodies of the
  OpenStack project. It is an elected group that represents the
  contributors to the project, and has oversight on all technical matters.
  The Technical Committee is formally defined in the OpenStack Foundation
  bylaws and further refined in the Technical Committee charter.

  The monthly meetings of the TC are primarily for status updates on
  initiatives being led by TC members. The community should not wait
  for a formal meeting to raise issues or bring questions to the TC.
