description:  >
  The charter for the project is focused narrowly on discovering pre-existing
  infrastructure and installed or running software. For example, given a URL
  and some credentials, discover which server(s) the URL is hosted on, the
  topology of the infrastructure and what software is running on each server,
  as well as, pertinent settings for commonly encountered software like
  apache, varnish, and mysql.
