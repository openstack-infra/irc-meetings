  The interop challenge was started in July 2016 to create a set of common
  workloads/tests to be executed across multiple OpenStack distributions
  and/or cloud deployment models. The participants in this challenge will
  work together to prove once and for all that OpenStack-Powered clouds are
  interoperable. Please join us if you are interested in particpating!
